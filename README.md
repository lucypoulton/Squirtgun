Squirtgun is a multi-purpose Java library that makes the development of cross-platform Minecraft server plugins and Discord bots easier.

I started maintaining this library so I could share logic between [ProNouns](https://lucypoulton.net/pronouns) and [ProFiles](https://lucypoulton.net/profiles),
namely a very basic command framework and some formatting code, the majority of which has since been replaced. Since then, it's grown significantly, and now does 
a lot more:

- Tree-like command framework (not specific to Minecraft)
- Formatting library built on Adventure
- Basic abstraction on top of Minecraft server APIs to allow for cross-platform plugins
- Discord platform to allow plugins to integrate with Discord, or use the command framework standalone

While most stuff has Javadoc comments, there's no real documentation at the moment, I'm the only person that uses this and I'm expecting it to stay that way until 
I tidy up the API a bit.
